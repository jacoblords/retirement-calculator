# Retirement Pathfinder

Client-side retirement calculator that models savings growth, inflation, taxes on withdrawals, and pre/post-retirement returns. It provides a year-by-year breakdown plus animated charts that update as you change inputs.

## Features
- Timeline + life expectancy planning inputs
- Separate pre- and post-retirement returns
- Inflation-adjusted retirement spending
- Taxes applied to withdrawals
- Year-by-year table and animated charts

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step required.

## Project structure

## Notes
The model assumes contributions occur at the start of each year and taxes apply only to withdrawals.
